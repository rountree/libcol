0. Create github repo.
    <details><summary>Notes</summary>
    Created the initial repo at github, which allowed me
    to choose a license (unlicense/public domain), populate
    a `.gitignore` file, and even generate a blank README.md.

1. Populate MILESTONES.md
    <details><summary>Goals</summary>
    Kinda curious to see how this works for small-project development.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Notes</summary>
    I rarely (never?) use this kind of written roadmap,
    but then I rarely (never?) write production code.
    </details>

2. Create bare-bones library and test harness.
    <details><summary>Goals</summary>
    Get a barebones library (`col.c`), header (`col.h`),
    test harness (`harness.c`), and `Makefile` up and 
    running. Use rpath to avoid messing with 
    `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. 
    </details>
    <details><summary>Notes</summary>
    It is fun to be `const` and `restrict` correct for
    parameters. Spent far too much time deciding what
    compiler to use (premature optimization).
